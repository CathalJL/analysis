Repo mainly as storage, contains older files from analysis app

Idea is that many non technical people in areas like retail or services could benefit from being able to easily use ML to analyse their data.
Goal for this is to add full error handling and essentially 'handhold' user through the process, abstracting away as much as possible.

- LLM component (TBD) to handle data requirements and explain their data/analysis to user
- Add multiple more models
- Graph handling (vision)
- RAG DB (probably just a vector db at this stage)

## On hold as web app I'm developing is more interesting to me at this moment. Update this by EoM.
